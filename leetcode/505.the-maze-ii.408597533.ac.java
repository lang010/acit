 * Testcase Example:  '[[0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,1,0],[1,1,0,1,1],[0,0,0,0,0]]\n[0,4]\n[4,4]'
 *
 * There is a ball in a maze with empty spaces and walls. The ball can go
 * through empty spaces by rolling up, down, left or right, but it won't stop
 * rolling until hitting a wall. When the ball stops, it could choose the next
 * direction.
 * 
 * Given the ball's start position, the destination and the maze, find the
 * shortest distance for the ball to stop at the destination. The distance is
 * defined by the number of empty spaces traveled by the ball from the start
 * position (excluded) to the destination (included). If the ball cannot stop
 * at the destination, return -1.
 * 
 * The maze is represented by a binary 2D array. 1 means the wall and 0 means
 * the empty space. You may assume that the borders of the maze are all walls.
 * The start and destination coordinates are represented by row and column
 * indexes.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input 1: a maze represented by a 2D array
 * 
 * 0 0 1 0 0
 * 0 0 0 0 0
 * 0 0 0 1 0
 * 1 1 0 1 1
 * 0 0 0 0 0
 * 
 * Input 2: start coordinate (rowStart, colStart) = (0, 4)
 * Input 3: destination coordinate (rowDest, colDest) = (4, 4)
 * 
 * Output: 12
 * 
 * Explanation: One shortest way is : left -> down -> left -> down -> right ->
 * down -> right.
 * ‚Å†            The total distance is 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 12.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input 1: a maze represented by a 2D array
 * 
 * 0 0 1 0 0
 * 0 0 0 0 0
 * 0 0 0 1 0
 * 1 1 0 1 1
 * 0 0 0 0 0
 * 
 * Input 2: start coordinate (rowStart, colStart) = (0, 4)
 * Input 3: destination coordinate (rowDest, colDest) = (3, 2)
 * 
 * Output: -1
 * 
 * Explanation: There is no way for the ball to stop at the destination.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * There is only one ball and one destination in the maze.
 * Both the ball and the destination exist on an empty space, and they will not
 * be at the same position initially.
 * The given maze does not contain border (like the red rectangle in the
 * example pictures), but you could assume the border of the maze are all
 * walls.
 * The maze contains at least 2 empty spaces, and both the width and height of
 * the maze won't exceed 100.
