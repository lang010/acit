 *
 * Given n points on a 1-D plane, where the i^th point (from 0 to n-1) is at x
 * = i, find the number of ways we can draw exactly k non-overlapping line
 * segments such that each segment covers two or more points. The endpoints of
 * each segment must have integral coordinates. The k line segments do not have
 * to cover all n points, and they are allowed to share endpoints.
 * 
 * Return the number of ways we can draw k non-overlapping line segments.Â Since
 * this number can be huge, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 4, k = 2
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: 
 * The two line segments are shown in red and blue.
 * The image above shows the 5 different ways {(0,2),(2,3)}, {(0,1),(1,3)},
 * {(0,1),(2,3)}, {(1,2),(2,3)}, {(0,1),(1,2)}.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 3, k = 1
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The 3 ways are {(0,1)}, {(0,2)}, {(1,2)}.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 30, k = 7
 * Output: 796297179
 * Explanation: The total number of possible ways to draw 7 line segments is
 * 3796297200. Taking this number modulo 10^9 + 7 gives us 796297179.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 4:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 5, k = 3
 * Output: 7
 * 
 * 
 * Example 5:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 3, k = 2
 * Output: 1
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 2 <= n <= 1000
 * 1 <= k <= n-1
