 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2,5]\n11'
 *
 * You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money
 * amount. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need
 * to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any
 * combination of the coins, return -1.
 * 
 * You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
 * Output: -1
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: coins = [1], amount = 0
 * Output: 0
 * 
 * 
 * Example 4:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: coins = [1], amount = 1
 * Output: 1
 * 
 * 
 * Example 5:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: coins = [1], amount = 2
 * Output: 2
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= coins.length <= 12
 * 1 <= coins[i] <= 2^31 - 1
 * 0 <= amount <= 10^4
