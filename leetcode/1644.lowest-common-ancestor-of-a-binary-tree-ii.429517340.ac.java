 * Given the root of a binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of
 * two given nodes, p and q. If either node p or q does not exist in the tree,
 * return null. All values of the nodes in the tree are unique.
 * 
 * According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: "The lowest common ancestor
 * of two nodes p and q in a binary tree T is the lowest node that has both p
 * and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself)".
 * A descendant of a node x is a node y that is on the path from node x to some
 * leaf node.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5. A node can be a descendant of
 * itself according to the definition of LCA.
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 10
 * Output: null
 * Explanation: Node 10 does not exist in the tree, so return null.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
 * -10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9
 * All Node.val are unique.
 * p != q
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Follow up:Â Can you find the LCA traversing the tree, without checking nodes
 * existence?
