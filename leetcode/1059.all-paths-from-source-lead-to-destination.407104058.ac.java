 *
 * Given the edges of a directed graph where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates
 * there is an edge between nodes ai and bi, and two nodes source and
 * destination of this graph, determine whether or not all paths starting from
 * source eventually, end at destination, that is:
 * 
 * 
 * At least one path exists from the source node to the destination node
 * If a path exists from the source node to a node with no outgoing edges, then
 * that node is equal to destination.
 * The number of possible paths from source to destination is a finite
 * number.
 * 
 * 
 * Return true if and only if all roads from source lead to destination.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[0,2]], source = 0, destination = 2
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: It is possible to reach and get stuck on both node 1 and node
 * 2.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[0,3],[1,2],[2,1]], source = 0, destination = 3
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: We have two possibilities: to end at node 3, or to loop over
 * node 1 and node 2 indefinitely.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[2,3]], source = 0, destination = 3
 * Output: true
 * 
 * 
 * Example 4:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,1],[1,2]], source = 0, destination = 2
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: All paths from the source node end at the destination node, but
 * there are an infinite number of paths, such as 0-1-2, 0-1-1-2, 0-1-1-1-2,
 * 0-1-1-1-1-2, and so on.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 5:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 2, edges = [[0,1],[1,1]], source = 0, destination = 1
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: There is infinite self-loop at destination node.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= n <= 10^4
 * 0 <= edges.lengthÂ <= 10^4
 * edges.length == 2
 * 0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1
 * 0 <= source <= n - 1
 * 0 <= destination <= n - 1
 * The given graph may have self-loops and parallel edges.
