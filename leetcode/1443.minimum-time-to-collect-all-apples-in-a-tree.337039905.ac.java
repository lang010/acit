 *
 * Given an undirected tree consisting of n vertices numbered from 0 to n-1,
 * which has some apples in their vertices. You spend 1 second to walk over one
 * edge of the tree. Return the minimum time in seconds you have to spend to
 * collect all apples in the tree, starting at vertex 0 and coming back to this
 * vertex.
 * 
 * The edges of the undirected tree are given in the array edges, where
 * edges[i] = [ai, bi] means that exists an edge connecting the vertices ai and
 * bi. Additionally, there is a boolean array hasApple, where hasApple[i] =
 * true means that vertex i has an apple; otherwise, it does not have any
 * apple.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], hasApple =
 * [false,false,true,false,true,true,false]
 * Output: 8 
 * Explanation: The figure above represents the given tree where red vertices
 * have an apple. One optimal path to collect all apples is shown by the green
 * arrows.  
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], hasApple =
 * [false,false,true,false,false,true,false]
 * Output: 6

 * Example 3:

 * [false,false,false,false,false,false,false]
 * Output: 0
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= n <= 10^5
 * edges.length == n - 1
 * edges[i].length == 2
 * 0 <= ai < bi <= n - 1
 * fromiÂ < toi
 * hasApple.length == n
 *
