 *
 * Design a max stack data structure that supports the stack operations and
 * supports finding the stack's maximum element.
 * 
 * Implement the MaxStack class:
 * 
 * 
 * MaxStack() Initializes the stack object.
 * void push(int x) Pushes element x onto the stack.
 * int pop() Removes the element on top of the stack and returns it.
 * int top() Gets the element on the top of the stack without removing it.
 * int peekMax() Retrieves the maximum element in the stack without removing
 * it.
 * int popMax() Retrieves the maximum element in the stack and removes it. If
 * there is more than one maximum element, only remove the top-most one.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input
 * ["MaxStack", "push", "push", "push", "top", "popMax", "top", "peekMax",
 * "pop", "top"]
 * [[], [5], [1], [5], [], [], [], [], [], []]
 * Output
 * [null, null, null, null, 5, 5, 1, 5, 1, 5]
 * 
 * Explanation
 * MaxStack stk = new MaxStack();
 * stk.push(5);   // [5] the top of the stack and the maximum number is 5.
 * stk.push(1);   // [5, 1] the top of the stack is 1, but the maximum is 5.
 * stk.push(5);   // [5, 1, 5] the top of the stack is 5, which is also the
 * maximum, because it is the top most one.
 * stk.top();     // return 5, [5, 1, 5] the stack did not change.
 * stk.popMax();  // return 5, [5, 1] the stack is changed now, and the top is
 * different from the max.
 * stk.top();     // return 1, [5, 1] the stack did not change.
 * stk.peekMax(); // return 5, [5, 1] the stack did not change.
 * stk.pop();     // return 1, [5] the top of the stack and the max element is
 * now 5.
 * stk.top();     // return 5, [5] the stack did not change.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * -10^7 <= x <= 10^7
 * At most 10^4 calls will be made to push, pop, top, peekMax, and popMax.
 * There will be at least one element in the stack when pop, top, peekMax, or
 * popMax is called.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Follow up: Could you come up with a solution that supports O(1) for each top
 * call and O(logn) for each other call?Â
