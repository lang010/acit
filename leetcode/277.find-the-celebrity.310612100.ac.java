 * Testcase Example:  '[[1,1,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]'
 *
 * Suppose you are at a party with n people (labeled from 0 to n - 1), and
 * among them, there may exist one celebrity. The definition of a celebrity is
 * that all the other n - 1 people know him/her, but he/she does not know any
 * of them.
 * 
 * Now you want to find out who the celebrity is or verify that there is not
 * one. The only thing you are allowed to do is to ask questions like: "Hi, A.
 * Do you know B?" to get information about whether A knows B. You need to find
 * out the celebrity (or verify there is not one) by asking as few questions as
 * possible (in the asymptotic sense).
 * 
 * You are given a helper function bool knows(a, b) which tells you whether A
 * knows B. Implement a function int findCelebrity(n).Â There will be exactly
 * one celebrity if he/she is in the party. Return the celebrity's label if
 * there is a celebrity in the party. If there is no celebrity, return -1.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: graph = [[1,1,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: There are three persons labeled with 0, 1 and 2. graph[i][j] =
 * 1 means person i knows person j, otherwise graph[i][j] = 0 means person i
 * does not know person j. The celebrity is the person labeled as 1 because
 * both 0 and 2 know him but 1 does not know anybody.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: graph = [[1,0,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: There is no celebrity.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * n == graph.length
 * n == graph[i].length
 * 2 <= n <= 100
 * graph[i][j] is 0 or 1.
 * graph[i][i] == 1
 *
