 *
 * The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at
 * which the corresponding bits are different.
 * 
 * Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.
 * 
 * Note:
 * 0 ≤ x, y < 2^31.
 * 
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * Input: x = 1, y = 4
 * 
 * Output: 2
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * 1   (0 0 0 1)
 * 4   (0 1 0 0)
