 *
 * Suppose Andy and Doris want to choose a restaurant for dinner, and they both
 * have a list of favorite restaurants represented by strings.
 * 
 * You need to help them find out their common interest with the least list
 * index sum. If there is a choice tie between answers, output all of them with
 * no order requirement. You could assume there always exists an answer.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 =
 * ["Piatti","The Grill at Torrey Pines","Hungry Hunter Steakhouse","Shogun"]
 * Output: ["Shogun"]
 * Explanation: The only restaurant they both like is "Shogun".
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 =
 * ["KFC","Shogun","Burger King"]
 * Output: ["Shogun"]
 * Explanation: The restaurant they both like and have the least index sum is
 * "Shogun" with index sum 1 (0+1).
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 =
 * ["KFC","Burger King","Tapioca Express","Shogun"]
 * Output: ["KFC","Burger King","Tapioca Express","Shogun"]
 * 
 * 
 * Example 4:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 =
 * ["KNN","KFC","Burger King","Tapioca Express","Shogun"]
 * Output: ["KFC","Burger King","Tapioca Express","Shogun"]
 * 
 * 
 * Example 5:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: list1 = ["KFC"], list2 = ["KFC"]
 * Output: ["KFC"]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= list1.length, list2.length <= 1000
 * 1 <= list1[i].length, list2[i].length <= 30
 * list1[i] and list2[i] consist of spaces ' ' and English letters.
 * All the stings of list1 are unique.
 * All the stings of list2Â are unique.
 *
