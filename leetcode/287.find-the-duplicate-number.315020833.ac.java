 *
 * Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer
 * is in the range [1, n] inclusive.
 * 
 * There is only one duplicate number in nums, return this duplicate number.
 * 
 * Follow-ups:
 * 
 * 
 * How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in nums? 
 * Can you solve the problem without modifying the array nums?
 * Can you solve the problem using only constant, O(1) extra space?
 * Can you solve the problem with runtime complexity less than O(n^2)?
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
 * Output: 2
 * Example 2:
 * Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
 * Output: 3
 * Example 3:
 * Input: nums = [1,1]
 * Output: 1
 * Example 4:
 * Input: nums = [1,1,2]
 * Output: 1
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 2 <= n <= 3 * 10^4
 * nums.length == n + 1
 * 1 <= nums[i] <= n
 * All the integers in nums appear only once except for precisely one integer
 * which appears two or more times.
