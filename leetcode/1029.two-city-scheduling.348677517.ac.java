 *
 * A company is planning to interview 2n people. Given the array costs where
 * costs[i] = [aCosti, bCosti],Â the cost of flying the i^th person to city a is
 * aCosti, and the cost of flying the i^th person to city b is bCosti.
 * 
 * Return the minimum cost to fly every person to a city such that exactly n
 * people arrive in each city.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: costs = [[10,20],[30,200],[400,50],[30,20]]
 * Output: 110
 * Explanation: 
 * The first person goes to city A for a cost of 10.
 * The second person goes to city A for a cost of 30.
 * The third person goes to city B for a cost of 50.
 * The fourth person goes to city B for a cost of 20.
 * 
 * The total minimum cost is 10 + 30 + 50 + 20 = 110 to have half the people
 * interviewing in each city.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: costs = [[259,770],[448,54],[926,667],[184,139],[840,118],[577,469]]
 * Output: 1859
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: costs =
 * [[515,563],[451,713],[537,709],[343,819],[855,779],[457,60],[650,359],[631,42]]
 * Output: 3086
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 2 * n == costs.length
 * 2 <= costs.length <= 100
 * costs.length is even.
 * 1 <= aCosti, bCosti <= 1000
 *
