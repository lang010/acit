 * Easy (76.98%)
 * Total Accepted:    48.5K
 * Total Submissions: 63.1K
 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3]\n[3,2,7]\n4'
 *
 * Given two integer arrays startTime and endTime and given an integer
 * queryTime.
 * 
 * The ith student started doing their homework at the time startTime[i] and
 * finished it at time endTime[i].
 * 
 * Return the number of students doing their homework at time queryTime. More
 * formally, return the number of students where queryTime lays in the interval
 * [startTime[i], endTime[i]] inclusive.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: startTime = [1,2,3], endTime = [3,2,7], queryTime = 4
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: We have 3 students where:
 * The first student started doing homework at time 1 and finished at time 3
 * and wasn't doing anything at time 4.
 * The second student started doing homework at time 2 and finished at time 2
 * and also wasn't doing anything at time 4.
 * The third student started doing homework at time 3 and finished at time 7
 * and was the only student doing homework at time 4.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: startTime = [4], endTime = [4], queryTime = 4
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: The only student was doing their homework at the queryTime.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: startTime = [4], endTime = [4], queryTime = 5
 * Output: 0
 * 
 * 
 * Example 4:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: startTime = [1,1,1,1], endTime = [1,3,2,4], queryTime = 7
 * Output: 0
 * 
 * 
 * Example 5:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: startTime = [9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1], endTime =
 * [10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10], queryTime = 5
 * Output: 5
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * startTime.length == endTime.length
 * 1 <= startTime.length <= 100
 * 1 <= startTime[i] <= endTime[i] <= 1000
 * 1 <= queryTime <= 1000
 *
