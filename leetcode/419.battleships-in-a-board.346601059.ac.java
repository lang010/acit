 * Given an 2D board, count how many battleships are in it. The battleships are
 * represented with 'X's, empty slots are represented with '.'s. You may assume
 * the following rules:
 * 
 * 
 * You receive a valid board, made of only battleships or empty slots.
 * Battleships can only be placed horizontally or vertically. In other words,
 * they can only be made of the shape 1xN (1 row, N columns) or Nx1 (N rows, 1
 * column), where N can be of any size.
 * At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two battleships -
 * there are no adjacent battleships.
 * 
 * 
 * Example:
 * X..X
 * ...X
 * ...X
 * 
 * In the above board there are 2 battleships.
 * 
 * Invalid Example:
 * ...X
 * XXXX
 * ...X
 * 
 * This is an invalid board that you will not receive - as battleships will
 * always have a cell separating between them.
 * 
 * Follow up:Could you do it in one-pass, using only O(1) extra memory and
 * without modifying the value of the board?
