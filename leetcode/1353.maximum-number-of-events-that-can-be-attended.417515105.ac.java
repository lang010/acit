 *
 * Given an array of events where events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi]. Every event
 * i starts at startDayi and ends at endDayi.
 * 
 * You can attend an event i at any day d where startTimei <= d <= endTimei.
 * Notice that you can only attend one event at any time d.
 * 
 * Return the maximum number of events you can attend.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: events = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: You can attend all the three events.
 * One way to attend them all is as shown.
 * Attend the first event on day 1.
 * Attend the second event on day 2.
 * Attend the third event on day 3.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: events= [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,2]]
 * Output: 4
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: events = [[1,4],[4,4],[2,2],[3,4],[1,1]]
 * Output: 4
 * 
 * 
 * Example 4:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: events = [[1,100000]]
 * Output: 1
 * 
 * 
 * Example 5:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: events = [[1,1],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[1,6],[1,7]]
 * Output: 7
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= events.length <= 10^5
 * events[i].length == 2
 * 1 <= startDayi <= endDayi <= 10^5
 *
